# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The telecommunications industry faces high customer attrition rates. This project analyzes a dataset of 7,000+ customers to identify why they leave and builds a Machine Learning model to predict churn.

**Goal:** Reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk segments and suggesting retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Data Visualization** (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, Random Forest)
* **Environment** (Google Colab, Jupyter)

## 📊 Key Insights
1.  **Contract Sensitivity:** Customers on month-to-month contracts are **10x more likely to churn** than those on 2-year contracts.
2.  **Fiber Optic Issues:** Users with Fiber Optic internet have a higher churn rate (41%) than DSL users, suggesting service quality or pricing issues.
3.  **The "Danger Zone":** The highest risk of attrition is within the first **6 months** of tenure.

## 🤖 Model Performance
We trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer behavior.
* **Precision:** (Insert your score here, e.g., 0.65)
* **Recall:** (Insert your score here, e.g., 0.55)
* **Top Predictors:** Contract Type, Tenure, Electronic Check Payment.

## 🚀 Recommendations
1.  **Incentivize Contracts:** Offer a 15% discount for month-to-month users who switch to a 1-year plan.
2.  **Improve Onboarding:** Implement a "First 90 Days" support program to prevent early tenure churn.
3.  **Audit Fiber Services:** Investigate technical issues in regions with high Fiber churn.
